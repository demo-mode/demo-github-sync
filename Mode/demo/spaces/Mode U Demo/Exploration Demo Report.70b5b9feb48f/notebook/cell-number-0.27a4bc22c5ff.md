Your query results are accessible in python as pandas DataFrames. You can access them in the variable `datasets` using the name of the query:

* __example__: `datasets["your query name"]`

**_Note:_** `datasets` **_will update when you run a SQL query. It is best to run queries after you rename them so that your Python Notebook has the latest results._**

If you prefer to access your query results in other ways, you can read more about datasets on [this Help page](https://help.modeanalytics.com/articles/how-to-use-datasets-in-python/).
